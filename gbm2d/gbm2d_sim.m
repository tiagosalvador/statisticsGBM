% 2D grain boundary motion with many grains. Isotropic, unequal
% surface tensions given by Read-Shockley. Mobilities determined
% by input variable "option".
%
% INPUT:
%   dt = time step size
%   grains = Data structure containing initial configuration of
%            grains. Cell array, with grains{k,1} = indicies of
%            pix near grain k, and grains{k,2} = level set vals
%            at those locations. Eventually, grains{k,3} and
%            grains{k,4} contains convolution values at same
%            locations for the two different kernels.
%   dims = Dimensions of the grid: dims=[n n] for nxn grid.
%   ori = Orientation data for grains. For now, column vector of
%         angles (2D crystallography, i.e. fiber texture).
%   Rgrains = radius by each a grain is enlarged.
%   Rfamilies = Minimum distance to maintain between grains in the same 
%               family.
%   angBrandon = Brandon angle in Read-Shockley model (degrees)
%   list_t = vector with times at which grain is saved.
%   filename = name of the file where intermidiate grains are stored.
%   option = 1 if all mobilities equal 1; = 2 if all mobilities
%            equal 1/(surface tension)
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% CAUTION:
%   Some C routines modify matlab data structures in place.
%   This is done in the interest of minimal memory utilization.
%   It has the undesirable side effect that input arrays cannot
%   be guaranteed to remain unaltered, especially 'grains', even
%   when the 1st output var ~= 3rd input var.
