# Threshold Dynamics Algorithms
This repository contains the code for the paper "The Role of Surface Tension and Mobility Model in Simulations of Grain Growth" by Tiago Salvador and Selim Esedoglu.

## Code
Start by compiling the different mex files in the folders 'gbm2d - c_files' and 'gbm3d - c_files'. This can be achieved with the scripts 'compile_c_files2d' and 'compile_c_files3d'.  The simulations presented in the paper can be generated using the script files with prefix 'get_results'. The different statistics can be computed using the functions with prefix 'data_analysis_script'. The different figures can be generated using the script files with prefix 'create'.

All the functions are commented, some more than others, and you can use the command help in matlab to find a description of what which function does and the inputs it receives.
